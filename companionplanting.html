        <h1>COMPANION PLANTING</h1>
        <h3>What is companion planting?</h3>
        <p>Did you know that the right (or wrong) combination of certain plants could actually make them more (or less) productive? </p>
            
            <p>The process is known as companion planting. It is believed that growing certain plants in close proximity to others may help deter pests, promote growth and even improve flavour — or on the opposite end of the spectrum, certain plants, when planted close to one another, may actually stunt each other’s growth.</p>

            <p>Companion plants are plants that complement one another in terms of growth and production. For example, one plant may attract an insect that might protect a companion plant. Another plant may act as a repellent for a bug that might be harmful to the plant next to it.</p>

            <p>It is also important to look at the nutrients individual plants need. A companion plant may need less of one specific nutrient while its neighbour desperately needs it to thrive. In this case, companion planting would eliminate the competition between the two plants.</p>
